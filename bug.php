This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys.  When you use a non-string value as an array key, PHP will implicitly convert it to a string. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with numeric keys that might be implicitly converted to the same string representation.

```php
<?php
$arr = [];
$arr[1] = 'one';
$arr[1.0] = 'one point zero';
$arr[(int)1.5] = 'one point five';

echo count($arr); //Outputs 2 instead of 3 
print_r($arr); // Shows only two entries
?>
```
